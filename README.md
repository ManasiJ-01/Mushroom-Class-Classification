# Mushroom-Class-Classification
This machine learning project tells the class to which the mushroom belongs to. 

Also it give visualization about the different classes of mushrooms like cap-shape, odor, cap-color etc.

#### It gives more idea whether the mushroom is eadible or poisonous.

#Following are the algorithms used in this project :
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Neural Network

Using SVM and neural network for mushroom class classification gives more accuracy than logistic regression.
